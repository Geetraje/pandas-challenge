Bootcamp - Module 4 challenge.
This challenge analyses data from a school district to help make strategic decisions.
We were given 2 data sets, one with schools data and the other with students data, the schools being common to both.
Both the data sets were merged and analysed to provide a District summary consisting of number of schools, students, budget, avarages of the scores and the percentage of students who passed.
The next task was to tease out data about each school in terms of the type, number of students, total budget,per student budget, average scores and percentage of passing students.
The highest 5 and lowest 5 performing schools are listed with all the data.
Average Math and Reading scores have been listed across grades in each school.
A table of how spending is related to scores in that school has also been listed.
Tables of how school size and type affects the scores has also been displayed.
